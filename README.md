# math_tools

A package for math utilitlies that started with Linear Algebra MATH 224. Eventuallly (some day), I plan on add more wrapper functions and subclassing for auto-differentiation and calculus tools from [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/autodiff) and [Sympy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/calculus.html).
